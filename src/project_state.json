  "summary": "Rebrand the web UI as “Goa Car Rental” with tagline “Best Bike & Car Rental in Goa + Free Travel Planner”, keep Mock/Simulation Mode available but DISABLED by default (no warning banner), and refactor “Plan My Trip” to use permanent Advanced Local Logic (smart mock data) fully inside the frontend (JavaScript) with NO backend/canister calls so it never crashes; ensure duration slicing works correctly (1 Day vs 3/5 Days), budget-specific hotel/food recommendations render from local Low/Medium/High datasets, and keep the WhatsApp CTA in the “Recommended Transport” card pointing to the real number (constructed via string concatenation) with prefilled text “I want to rent a car in Goa”.",
  "architectural_notes": [
    "Implement as a standalone HTML/CSS/JS page (no framework required) with responsive layout and a dedicated results section for rendering itinerary output.",
    "Replace simulated placeholder output with a real itinerary generation call (OpenAI API) or a deterministic mock; parse/structure the response to render day-wise plan, food spots, and “Recommended Transport (Desi Musafir Rentals)” in the results section.",
    "Enhance results rendering to be more app-like: transport as a highlighted gold/yellow bordered card with title \"⭐ Recommended: Rent from Desi Musafir Rentals\" and a green CTA button \"Book Now on WhatsApp\" (placeholder link https://wa.me/919999999999); itinerary as a day-wise timeline using emojis for Morning/Afternoon/Evening; food spots as clickable tags/chips.",
    "Support a Mock/Simulation Mode that bypasses the Internet Computer backend/API calls and returns hardcoded sample itinerary data on “Plan My Trip” for UI testing when the canister is down.",
    "Rebrand UI text: app name/title must be “Goa Car Rental” and tagline must be exactly “Best Bike & Car Rental in Goa + Free Travel Planner”.",
    "Mock-mode itinerary rendering must be dynamic based on selected Duration: display only Day 1..N from the mock itinerary (not a static always-3-day output).",
    "WhatsApp CTA must link to the real number constructed via string concatenation in code (const number = \"91\" + \"7861015148\";) and open https://wa.me/${number}?text=I want to rent a car in Goa.",
    "Mock/Simulation Mode must be available but OFF by default; real OpenAI API path is the default behavior for production builds.",
    "Remove the “Simulation Mode Active” banner entirely; Mock Mode should not show a persistent warning banner.",
    "Fix `generatePlan` mock itinerary generation: maintain a hardcoded array of 7 unique day plans (Day 1..Day 7) and strictly slice/filter to the selected Duration (e.g., 1 -> Day 1 only; 3 -> Day 1-3; 5 -> Day 1-5), never rendering extra days."
  ],
  "known_issues": [
    "Current UI only displays a simulated placeholder message (“backend will soon generate...”) instead of a real, detailed itinerary.",
    "Results section content currently feels too simple/static; transport, itinerary, and food spots need more interactive, professional UI components (highlighted transport card + WhatsApp CTA, timeline, and clickable chips).",
    "Backend canister may be stopped (“Canister stopped” error), causing the current Plan My Trip flow to fail; need a mock/static-data fallback mode to verify UI without backend availability.",
    "Deployment is currently failing due to a safety flag; user requested resetting code to the last working version and rebuilding.",
    "Branding still shows “Desi Musafir”; must be changed to “Goa Car Rental” and tagline updated.",
    "Mock-mode plan output is currently static; must be filtered/rendered based on the user-selected Duration.",
    "WhatsApp CTA still points to a placeholder/dummy number; must open WhatsApp to the real number using concatenated string construction and prefilled message.",
    "Mock Mode toggle is currently ON by default; should be OFF on initial load.",
    "“Simulation Mode Active” warning banner is still visible; must be removed.",
    "App is not currently forcing the real OpenAI API itinerary generation logic as requested for the real deployment."
