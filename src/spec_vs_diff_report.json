  "summary": "The diff updates the Low-budget local dataset transport bullets to the requested four pricing-free lines, but does not provide evidence that the actual UI-rendered “Recommended Transport” gold card (and all itinerary generation paths) were updated to use these exact bullets and remove prior price strings (₹1200/₹400) from that section.",

      "requirement": "Update the text content rendered inside the \"Recommended Transport\" highlighted gold card so it contains no explicit pricing and uses the exact new bullet lines provided by the user, while keeping the existing WhatsApp CTA button unchanged.",
      "reason": "Only the Low budget dataset transport array is shown updated. There is no diff evidence that the gold card rendering component was updated to use these exact four lines, nor that other itinerary sources (e.g., sample/mock itinerary text) no longer include \"₹1200\" or \"₹400\" in the Recommended Transport section. The diff summary also does not show confirmation that the gold card title and WhatsApp CTA behavior remained unchanged.",
