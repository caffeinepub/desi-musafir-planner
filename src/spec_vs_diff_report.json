  "summary": "Implemented default Mock/Simulation Mode via a dedicated mock mutation hook and a UI toggle; added a single-source WhatsApp URL constant set to the requested dummy number; updated itinerary parsing to recognize a \"Recommended Transport\" section and to avoid duplicating the star-title line. However, the diff summary does not provide enough evidence that the deployment safety-flag issue was addressed or that the transport card renders with the exact required title and placement.",
